3,Is this how it ends? 1k to 1M back to 20k trading (150k still in checkings) Final Hurrah,"Yes. First of all I am alive. Secondly as many of you know my last trade with MSTR blew up, i stubbornly held until i cut the position for 20k. Lot of hate messages and lot of love I read. Well im alright. I obviously regret not taking a break after I hit the 1M balance. No fkn shit. But it is what it is. Im a regard through and through. 

Currently still have 150k in my checkings that I do not intend on re injecting. Will attach history of my RH transactions, strictly have only been withdrawing and not depositing like many of you are wondering. I dont have it in me to lose this still sizeable amount. I need to have something to show for my once in a lifetime god run lol. 

That being said, the 20k i have left in my checkings I intend to full port into one last and final play. If i blow up then i take a break and restart my account next year with 5-10k. I will put the majority of the 150k in MSTR shares. If i make it out of this play alive, I will share update, and if not I probably wont post again unless I have monster win in the future. I believe in transparency and keeping same energy in wins and losses. So thats why i made this post. My final play will be PLTR 80c weeklies. Thank you all for making me WSB famous for 3 weeks. Im a true WSB regard, i take no pride or shame in that. I wish i took the milly and ran but nothing I can do now. 🫡","Is this how it ends? 1k to 1M back to 20k trading (150k still in checkings) Final Hurrah Yes. First of all I am alive.

7,"South Korean stocks down 6% today on South Korea declaring martial law, buy the dip","The news sounds scary, but it's just the president declaring martial law because he's upset that his opposition won, and because they are launching a corruption investigation into him/his wife, so he's trying to paint them as North Korea supporters. There's no actual emergency, North Korea hasn't done anything, it's just lame duck president stirring up trouble.

South Korean markets were already insanely cheap before this dip, trading at 11-12x earnings, compared to 31x earnings for the US markets.

Positions: Buying EWY today

edit: I bought EWY at $53-54. It's at $55.50 now, I wouldn't buy above $55 unless the situation is resolved and fx rates recover, because IMO korean stocks will dip when their market opens.

edit 2: Korean Parliament voted to overturn the martial law declaration, also their Finance Minister stated that unlimited liquidity injections and other measures will be enacted if necessary to maintain stability. I'm holding for now, but refraining from buying more unless it dips below $54 again.

edit 3: Military is saying martial law still in effect until the president cancels it. I'm being cautious, sold some at $55.30 but still holding most, not buying any more at this price bc at this point most of the remaining drop can be attributed to fx rates, I think Koreans will dump stocks when their market opens in the morning.

Edit 4: president says he'll end martial law. That was fun. ez gains. At this point the drop in price is roughly equal to the Korean won's depreciation, suggesting that the market is pricing the korean market opening flat. I'm still bullish long term on Korea but I can definitely see a dip after hours when the Korean market opens.","South Korean stocks down 6% today on South Korea declaring martial law, buy the dip The news sounds scary, but it's just the president declaring martial law because he's upset that his opposition won, and because they are launching a corruption investigation into him/his wife, so he's trying to paint them as North Korea supporters.

18,SMCI - value or trap?,"I have seen many post about SMCI and highlighting its potential undervalued qualities. Many see it *growing* to $160 a share, but in a crowd of bulls I will be one of the bears on the company. 

Whenever one wants to get a feel for what the priorities of a company are one should look no further than how executives are rewarded. CEO Charles Liang went from a salary + options package prior to 2021 to a $1.00 salary & pure options/RSU package in March of 2021 when the **2021 CEO Performance Package** was passed. Interesting timing given the boom in the AI markets. Mr. Liang cannot have his salary or other cash  comp adjusted until June 30th, 2026.

One of the KPI's was based around none other than share price appreciation. The package was awarded and set at a share price of $34.08 and the goals were broken into five tranches with the highest being $120 a share and all this needed to be hit by September 30th, 2026. This would have been a CAGR of 25% over ~5.5 years but lucky for SMCI shareholders this was achieved in ~2.2 years for a 75% CAGR. 

In November 2023 the compensation package was adjusted with the approval of the **2023 CEO Compensation Package** where SMCI was again lucky enough to achieve almost all goals on share price appreciation on these new tranches too. 

Their CFO had no KPI's around the company's health. Nothing regarding leverage ratios, operating income, cash flow generation, but three KPI's that were 1) share price appreciation (2X weighted), long-term investor increase (2X weighted), and an individual performance measured by Mr. Liang. The CFO being rewarded heavily on share price appreciation and attractive investing should be a red flag. And while the CFO achieved these goals in such a short time, he has now been rewarded with losing his job. One must ask why?

Another target is around revenue growth and while any company should be focused on revenue, the above KPI's highlight a culture that is focused on driving share price appreciation before all else. There is an active whistleblower lawsuit stating SMCI improperly recognized revenue and just today that same whistleblower doubled down on such claims. 

December 5th, 2023 SMCI made a public offering of 2,415,805 shares, then they went and issued convertible notes in February 2024, then on March 22nd, 2024 they went and issued another round of equity for 2,000,000 shares. All of this equity at a time when executives are rewarded for share price gains.

The Ablecom/Compuware relationship has been called out and I think it should have more attention. There is a lot of PO movement between these companies that are all owned by relatives. These two companies also handle design work, tool builds, and various other things; do we know where all the debt lies and perhaps CAPEX is understated as it's absorbed elsewhere? Impossible to say either way given we can't get public financials for these other organizations. No comment from SMCI leaves investors left to speculate. 

Now we get to the recent news of EY resigning. I have seen some estimates that EY was walking from multiple million dollar deal in being the auditor for SMCI, what did they see? Given the trouble EY has had over the past few years with a failed split and SEC fines, walking away from a potential AI darling account seems very difficult to understand. In the 8-K statement filed by SMCI, EY was quoted as ***""we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”***, which is no light statement. Yet, an internal investigation by SMCI finds nothing that aligned with what EY found? No discrepancy at all? This investigation by SMCI was led by someone who is now a board member, but of course Mr. Market rallies on the news of ""no fault"" but the pieces do not fit.

The recent cancellations of two bank facilities should also raise red flags. It is clear if you read the terms that SMCI was in violation of debt covenants and would have been in default, but these terminations now constrict liquidity. SMCI has stated they will possibly need these lending facilities to fund inventory as they see growth, but because of these filings delays and auditor resignations they cancelled them. I am not seeing many talk about the future growth constraints from this move. It also highlights there may be more here because why not work with the banks? Unless of course you have no intention of filing your 10-K/Q anytime soon or there is true risks on what BDO finds. 

While the above may indeed be nothing, I am having a hard time reading the recent events as bullish. While a self audit is good show and will likely prevent a delisting, the delayed 10-K/Q gives investors no insight into where the company stands. It is possible BDO will begin their audit and find gaps the same as EY. The equity offerings at a time when executives are rewarded for share price appreciation also is a red flag from an investor POV as your dilution is funding direct reward. The MOAT for SMCI is not as strong as many state and the margins are not either. 

While this may be value in many investors eyes, there is some big risks here that I see ignored because stoinks only go up.

**Edit:** corrected the second sentence from ""many see it return"" to ""many see it growing"" which is what I meant.","SMCI - value or trap?

# What the hell is it?

Autolus Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in CAR-T cell therapies aimed at treating various cancers. Their flagship product, Aucatzyl (obecabtagene autoleucel), targets relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).

# Recent Developments

* **FDA Approval:** On November 8, 2024, the FDA approved Aucatzyl for adult patients with r/r B-ALL, marking a significant milestone for the company. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Clinical Data Publication:** The New England Journal of Medicine published data from the pivotal Phase 1b/2 FELIX study of Aucatzyl, reporting a 76.6% overall response rate with a low incidence of severe immune-related toxicities. Needless to say, this is a huge deal.

# Financial Health

As of Q3 September 30, 2024, Autolus reported:

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** $657.1 million, up from $239.6 million as of December 31, 2023. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Total Operating Expenses:** $67.9 million for Q3 2024, compared to $42.9 million for the same period in 2023.
* **Net Loss:** $82.1 million for Q3 2024, up from $45.8 million in Q3 2023.

The company estimates that its current cash reserves are sufficient to support the full launch and commercialization of Aucatzyl in r/r adult B-ALL, as well as advance its pipeline development plans.

# Technical Analysis

(Take this part with a grain of salt, because I'm 100% regurgitating the information I found.) The stock is trading above its short-term and long-term moving averages, indicating a potential bullish trend.

* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 14-day RSI is at 37.34%, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **Stochastic Oscillator:** 14-day value at 31.91%, also indicating potential oversold conditions.
* **MACD:** The MACD line is below the signal line, a bearish indicator suggesting downward momentum.
* **Support and Resistance Levels:**
   * **Support:** $2.80
   * **Resistance:** $3.50

Breaking above the $3.50 resistance could signal a bullish reversal, while dropping below the $2.80 support may lead to further declines.

# Bull Case

* **Regulatory Milestone:** FDA approval of Aucatzyl positions Autolus as a key player in the CAR-T therapy market.
* **Strong Clinical Data:** High response rates with low toxicity enhance the therapy's market potential.
* **Solid Cash Position:** With over $657 million in cash, the company is well-funded for commercialization and pipeline development.
* **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts have set **an average price target of $10.20**, suggesting significant upside potential. ([Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/autl/forecast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Bear Case

* **Market Competition:** The CAR-T therapy space is competitive, with established players like Novartis and Gilead.
* **Financial Losses:** Increasing net losses may raise concerns about long-term profitability.
* **Execution Risks:** Challenges in manufacturing, distribution, and market adoption could impact commercial success.

# Conclusion

Autolus Therapeutics has achieved significant milestones with the FDA approval of Aucatzyl and promising clinical data. While the stock has experienced recent volatility, sure, the long-term outlook appears positive, especially considering the potential market impact of their CAR-T therapies. Therefore, especially considering that analysts believe this is either a strong buy or simply undervalued, this is a great play for the next 12 months. That being said, you do you, and manage your own risks. **Biotech is notoriously high risk, high reward, so keep that in mind.**

  
My position is 3,770 shares.

Edit: Now at 3,850 shares @$3.17.

","$AUTL - Insanely Undervalued Cancer Treatment Hey, I don't know why more people aren't talking about this, so here I go doing my best to articulate how excited I am for this stock.

# What the hell is it?

Autolus Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in CAR-T cell therapies aimed at treating various cancers. Their flagship product, Aucatzyl (obecabtagene autoleucel), targets relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).

# Recent Developments

* **FDA Approval:** On November 8, 2024, the FDA approved Aucatzyl for adult patients with r/r B-ALL, marking a significant milestone for the company. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Clinical Data Publication:** The New England Journal of Medicine published data from the pivotal Phase 1b/2 FELIX study of Aucatzyl, reporting a 76.6% overall response rate with a low incidence of severe immune-related toxicities. Needless to say, this is a huge deal.

# Financial Health

As of Q3 September 30, 2024, Autolus reported:

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** $657.1 million, up from $239.6 million as of December 31, 2023. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/autolus-therapeutics-reports-third-quarter-120000687.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

31,"Apple's stock price hits a new high, recapturing the number one spot in market cap. Is a new 'super product cycle' on the horizon?","**As 2025 approaches, the countdown is on for the release of a number of new Apple products. According to reports, Apple will bring a series of anticipated new products in the spring of 2025, covering a number of popular product lines such as the iPhone SE, iPad and MacBook Air. Are investors ready for a new “super cycle”?**

  
**Monday, $ Apple (AAPL.US)$ closed up 0.95%, shares rose to $ 239.59, hitting a new record high, the total market capitalization exceeded 3.62 trillion U.S. dollars, regaining the first global market value throne, compared with the second place of the NVIDIA has been higher than 250 billion U.S. dollars. This year, Apple's cumulative increase of 25.06%.**

https://preview.redd.it/jl4uvvmlvn4e1.jpg?width=1190&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eaaf5b5c125c2c57a431153bcec0f0a65106ec0

  
It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

36,Tried to gamble my way out of debt - Didn’t work :(,"Well here it goes. 

About a year ago I dumped about 5k into a company that I may or may not have had private knowledge of. I thought I was so smart, turns out that less than a month later all my shares are worthless because the company filed for bankruptcy. 

Fast forward a couple months and my position was eliminated and I have been searching for jobs but been unemployed ever since. That 5k was a big chunk of my savings and with being unemployed and having bills to pay I quickly ran out of cash. I racked up about 12,000 in credit card debt and needed money fast. 

So naturally, I started gambling. I gambled by using this same credit card on some sketchy online casino, I didn’t deposit much at once, usually only $100 or so, but man I realized I had a gambling addiction once I spent over 4k on this site. I was making the money back but then I was chasing my losses and lost it all. 

Then autopay resumed on my card and tried to charge my entire balance which I didn’t have and Amex canceled my card. I was still making my monthly payments before that. 

So now I’m 16k in debt on this card, 3k on another, and have about $100 to my name. I sold my computers and guns and anything worth money but now I don’t know how I am going to pay my bills this month. 

Guys, please be careful, be honest with yourselves, casino gambling and options gambling are both just as dangerous. You have to limit yourself or else you are a few bad days away from being like me. 

I don’t know what I’m gonna do anymore but I thought I’d leave a warning for other degenerate gamblers like me.

51,Teladoc Health (TDOC): Why It’s Poised for a Comeback,"#

Hello fellow degenerates,

Let’s talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you’ve been following, you know it’s been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it’s now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here’s my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback.&#x20;

---

## 1. **Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land**

Teladoc’s stock has seen better days, but as of now:

- **Stock Price:** \$10.95 (down slightly today).
- **52-Week Range:** From scraping the barrel at \$9.50 to peaking around \$30.
- **Market Cap:** Roughly \$1.8 billion.

This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount.

---

## 2. **Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start**

In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing **Chuck Divita** as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes:

- Leadership roles in companies like **Humana**, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency.
- A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units.

Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come.

---

## 3. **Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks**

Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024:

- **Goodwill Impairment:** They took a \$790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit?
- **Net Loss:** \$838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer).
- **Revenue:** \$650 million (up 5% YOY).

### Why This Isn’t All Bad News:

- The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth.
- BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy.
- TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management.

---

## 4. **Market Position: Still a Leader**

Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with:

- 80+ million members.
- Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health.
- A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management.

### Competitors:

Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc’s ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions.

---

## 5. **Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay**

The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere. Key stats:

- **Market Growth:** The global telehealth market is projected to reach \$560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%).
- **Adoption Rates:** 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care.
- **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025.

Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand.

---

## 6. **Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy?**

At its current price, Teladoc trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x. For comparison:

- **Amwell:** 2.3x P/S.
- **Healthcare Sector Average:** 4.0x P/S.

This signals Teladoc is significantly undervalued relative to peers, especially given its revenue growth.

---

## 7. **Catalysts: What Could Drive a Comeback?**

- **Profitability Goals:** Teladoc aims to achieve positive EBITDA by mid-2025.
- **Product Expansion:** Launching AI-powered tools for personalized care.
- **Potential Acquisition Target:** At its current valuation, TDOC could attract interest from larger healthcare players.

---

## 8. **Risks: No Rose-Colored Glasses**

- **Competition:** Amazon is in this space. Relentless as fuck as always.
- **Marketing Spend:** Scaling back on ads could slow growth in the short term but is smart for a branding reboot.
- **Macroeconomic Factors:** Higher interest rates make growth companies less attractive to some investors.

## 9. **Conclusion: Why I’m Bullish**

Teladoc is a classic turnaround story. Yes, it’s been beaten down, but the fundamentals—leadership changes, cost-cutting, and a growing market—suggest a brighter future. At its current valuation, the risk-reward ratio looks attractive.

Do I want to be convinced otherwise? Fucking no so leave me alone bc I’m sensitive.

---

### TL;DR

- New leadership and strategic reset.
- Strong market position in a growing industry.
- Valuation suggests upside potential.
- Risks exist, but the reward looks worth it.

","Teladoc Health (TDOC): Why It’s Poised for a Comeback #

Hello fellow degenerates,

Let’s talk about Teladoc (TDOC). If you’ve been following, you know it’s been through the fire and the flames. Once a darling of the telehealth boom, it’s now more like the kid who got benched after fucking up the big game. But I believe the tide is about to turn. Here’s my DD on why Teladoc might just be gearing up for a glorious comeback.&#x20;

---

## 1. **Current Stock Snapshot: The Lay of the Land**

Teladoc’s stock has seen better days, but as of now:

- **Stock Price:** \$10.95 (down slightly today).
- **52-Week Range:** From scraping the barrel at \$9.50 to peaking around \$30.
- **Market Cap:** Roughly \$1.8 billion.

This might look like a crash and burn to some, but I see opportunity at a discount.

---

## 2. **Leadership Overhaul: A Fresh Start**

In June 2024, Teladoc made a bold move by appointing **Chuck Divita** as CEO. For context, Divita’s background includes:

- Leadership roles in companies like **Humana**, where he focused on growth and operational efficiency.
- A track record of successfully restructuring struggling business units.

Divita’s focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations has already started to show results in the company’s latest reporting and the best is yet to come.

---

## 3. **Financial Performance: Clearing the Decks**

Let’s address the elephant in the room: Teladoc’s financials. Here’s what we know from Q2 2024:

- **Goodwill Impairment:** They took a \$790 million write-down on BetterHelp, their mental health arm, which has a dogshit reputation, especially after their data privacy scandal. Believe it or not, people don’t want their deepest secrets and personal data sold to third parties. Whodathunkit?
- **Net Loss:** \$838 million (yikes, but let’s look closer).
- **Revenue:** \$650 million (up 5% YOY).

### Why This Isn’t All Bad News:

- The goodwill impairment is an accounting adjustment. It’s painful now, but it clears the books for future growth.
- BetterHelp’s revenue decline is a reflection of tightened marketing spend, which aligns with the new CEO’s cost-cutting strategy.
- TDOC has had a steady upward trend in revenue growth YOY. A good sign of internal management.

---

## 4. **Market Position: Still a Leader**

Teladoc remains a dominant player in telehealth, with:

- 80+ million members.
- Partnerships with major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health.
- A robust tech platform that integrates telehealth, mental health, and chronic condition management.

### Competitors:

Teladoc’s main rivals are Amwell and MDLIVE, but neither has the same level of services, and also Amwell is dogshit. Teladoc’s ecosystem approach makes it stand out, especially as big employers and insurers need seamless integrated solutions.

---

## 5. **Industry Outlook: Telehealth Is Here to Stay**

The pandemic normalized virtual care, but the trend isn’t going anywhere. Key stats:

- **Market Growth:** The global telehealth market is projected to reach \$560 billion by 2030 (CAGR of 24%).
- **Adoption Rates:** 40% of patients now prefer telehealth for routine care.
- **Regulatory Tailwinds:** The U.S. government has extended telehealth reimbursement policies through 2025.

Teladoc is uniquely positioned to capture this growth, thanks to its first-mover advantage and established brand.

---

## 6. **Valuation: A Bargain Basement Buy?**

At its current price, Teladoc trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x. For comparison:

- **Amwell:** 2.3x P/S.
- **Healthcare Sector Average:** 4.0x P/S.

This signals Teladoc is significantly undervalued relative to peers, especially given its revenue growth.

---

## 7. **Catalysts: What Could Drive a Comeback?**

- **Profitability Goals:** Teladoc aims to achieve positive EBITDA by mid-2025.
- **Product Expansion:** Launching AI-powered tools for personalized care.
- **Potential Acquisition Target:** At its current valuation, TDOC could attract interest from larger healthcare players.

---

## 8. **Risks: No Rose-Colored Glasses**

- **Competition:** Amazon is in this space. Relentless as fuck as always.
- **Marketing Spend:** Scaling back on ads could slow growth in the short term but is smart for a branding reboot.
- **Macroeconomic Factors:** Higher interest rates make growth companies less attractive to some investors.

55,MRNA Turnaround,"What’s up guys?  Check my profile if you want to see the original MRNA post.  I honestly couldn’t be happier with how today played out.  After a promising open, we saw a big shakeout as we dumped from 43.85 to 41.50.  We made a beautiful triple bottom there, and steadily climbed the rest of the day to finish  up 2.81% at 44.30.  Seeing buyers step in here like that is very encouraging, and it seems like the selling is over, at least in the short term.

On the daily, the trend line is broken in my opinion.  Decent volume, more than Thursday and Friday, but I’d like to see more like what we saw early last week.  But seeing a strong green candle close near the high of the day like that to break the trend is very encouraging to me.   On the hourly, I’m seeing an incredibly clean bull flag.  I’m also seeing the 50 day EMA ready to cross above the 100 day EMA.  This is very significant to me.  The last time that happened was on April 23.  The stock traded at 104 on that day, and ran to 168 by May 24.  I’m really hoping other traders see this cross and trend line break, and we get a big influx of volume tomorrow/rest of the week.  I’m sure most of you remember, but MRNA was one of THE meme stocks during covid.  When this thing picks up volume, it can make some insane daily swings, and it’s super fun to trade.  

The options data is still super bullish as well.  The put/call ratio on the volume was 0.17 today(extremely bullish).  The open interest is 0.28(very bullish).    My 45 calls are clearly the favorite here.  I highly doubt that is all WSB regards.  Someone else sees the same setup.  

According to their website, they are going to release their CMV vacccine phase 3 data before the end of the year.  If the data is positive, that could be a huge boost for their revenue, and therefore their stock price.  Our beloved Pharma Bro agrees with that sentiment, and recently called the stock a buy on his stream.   I’m wondering if someone thinks they’ll release the data this week, and that it’ll have a positive impact on the price.  

Some concerns:  CMV data being bad = tank.  They could also pull a Ryan Cohen and do a stock offering on a very positive day.  I’ve found some conflicting numbers, but it seems their cash on hand is around 11-12 billion.  Pretty solid, but they’re burning almost a billion a quarter.  This could ruin any potential big runs(at least temporarily, screwing short term call holders).  Also, it could just start going back in the shitter for no reason like it’s been doing for months and this is just another dead cat bounce.  


I noticed some interesting developments over the weekend as well.  The number of very recent articles about avian flu is surprising.  I can’t link articles here for some reason, but just search and you’ll be surprised.  I believe 55 people have been infected so far, and a lot of milk/egg products have been contaminated.  The cases have been mild, but mutations can occur rapidly.   Back in July, the government gave MRNA 176 million dollars to research an avian flu vaccine.  Given their relationship from Covid, I think MRNA is very well positioned to make significant money if this becomes a bigger problem.
That might be why the stock is seeing more interest.  

As for me, I’m still holding my 12/6 45c’s.  I’m going to see what tomorrow brings. I’m cautiously optimistic.  I have a feeling we see $45 tomorrow, but I’m watching $46.  Thats where it was rejected a week ago.  If we break that, then back test and hold, I’ll be very happy.  My calls are currently up 30% because i bought on Friday.  If i can get 100% or better, It’ll be hard not to sell.  If you’re holding calls, consider the concern I laid out and make your own decision.  Pay attention to the volume tomorrow and Wednesday, that will be key.  None of this is financial advice, just sharing my own thoughts. 

And to all of you who messaged me about the sat&nist globalist cabal forcing vaccines on us, go back to r/conspiracy.  I’m here to make money.","MRNA Turnaround What’s up guys?

57,$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of “To the Moon”. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they’ve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can’t RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can’t Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can’t do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They’d have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don’t see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20’s, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
4/17/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

Also - it is impossible to have covered all the bases in this, so shoot your questions below and let's discuss. Happy to try and answer/clarify any of the above points. Lastly, I am a complete regard lol I could be wrong; not financial advice.","$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret.

69,GTLB - DD,"Okay y’all this is my first time doing one of these, so please be patient.

People have asked me about this trade for a while now, so here are my thoughts.

I give this a buy rating for the earnings call.

Here is why.

The daily, weekly, and monthly charts are showing undervalued with positive upside as indicated by the Bollinger bands.


The MACD is indicating a buy crossover at the end of a long red period.

Implied volatility seems to say there will be a +-13.5% move.

Previous earnings look good, not too worried about anything in the news.

Spy is red today and is generally pulling other stocks, down, but GTLB is pushing back.

My expectation is that we buy now, hold through earnings because this is the perfect setup for that discount pricing.

SPY recovers in a day or two and trends up giving the market a boost. When earnings come, it will catapult. The charts say it is going up, spy will boost that. If it goes down, spy will slow it a little, but I would expect a 3m period of holding to get out at the current price if it drops by 13%.

So, there we have it, a perfect setup, with market boosting, and earnings catalyst ready to push up.

My anticipated price target is $71.

Thoughts?","GTLB - DD Okay y’all this is my first time doing one of these, so please be patient.

People have asked me about this trade for a while now, so here are my thoughts.

I give this a buy rating for the earnings call.

Here is why.

The daily, weekly, and monthly charts are showing undervalued with positive upside as indicated by the Bollinger bands.

70,SP500 Historical PE Ratio indicates market correction?,"I've been looking into the historical PE ratio of the SP500, to get an overall indication of how the market was during each year and how it faired leading up to a crash. 

From the 50s up until the 90s the SP500 PE ratio was fluctuating between 10-20. Before the dotcom bubble bursting the PE ratio was almost 30 (and then it went up not because the prices went up, but because the earnings went down due to the bubble bursting).

Same thing before the 2008 crash, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in Sep 2008 and the PE ratio was trending around 28 points before that. Then the PE ratio was corrected and until 2016 it was below 20 points again.

Finally we can see that in the last 5 years the PE ratio has been inflated and trends between 20 - 25 points, except for 2020 where earnings went down so it went to 30. 

Currently we are at 27 points and are approaching 30 without having a major event to cause earnings to drop which means prices are super inflated. Someone may just say that things in the market have changed meme stocks etc. but the basics always remain the same. 

I believe we can't reach PE ratio of 30 and above without having a big correction in the next 1-2 years, even if people say that bull markets last >5 years","SP500 Historical PE Ratio indicates market correction?

AWS' AI strategy: long-term growth vs. short-term incentives

AWS' continued investment in R&D for AI technology has given it a strong position in the market. From infrastructure support (e.g., in-house chips Inferentia and Trainium) to service-level AI models and development tools, AWS is building a complete ecosystem. This update may focus on the following areas:

Generative AI services: the key to competing with Microsoft and Google may be to expand the application scenarios of already existing AI services, such as healthcare, finance and other high value-added industries

Model optimization and cost reduction: through hardware improvement and algorithm optimization, it is cheaper and more efficient for customers to run AI models in the cloud.

Industry customized solutions: AWS's industry cloud strategy may be further deepened to create customized solutions for customers with the help of AI.

For investors, AWS's AI strategy is not only related to the market share of its cloud computing business, but also directly affects Amazon's overall revenue [performance.AWS](http://performance.AWS) already contributes nearly 70% of Amazon's operating profit, and further strengthening of its AI technology and services will help Amazon consolidate its position as a tech giant and provide sustained growth momentum for its stock (AMZN), which is currently on an uptrend that expects the stock to reach $230 in the next two months.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” approach could increase production and put downward pressure on oil prices, which might explain this move from OPEC+.

But shouldn’t energy companies benefit if there’s support from the government? Why would companies like OXY or similar ones fall even further if oil production increases? Additionally, I’ve read that China’s demand is likely to peak by mid-2025, which could be another factor contributing to a drop in oil prices.

86,Bigbear.AI is easily a 2-3 billion dollar company,"**What is it and why would I buy a stock with BEAR in the title:**

Bigbear is an Al-powered decision-making and analytics platform with a strong focus on government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence agencies. Their software helps organizations predict, visualize, and act on complex data to drive better outcomes. They’re basically predicting the future (kidding… maybe).

**Why invest in the big bad bear:**

1. Contracts contracts contracts, follow the yellow brick road of contracts. 5 year $165m US army contract and NSA contract (either for undisclosed amount or I am simply too regarded to find). Potentially more on the horizon. 

2. The bear shares many similarities to Palantir in regard to their pursuit of AI solutions and machine learning cloud-based software. Both of their software aim to help organizations analyze complex data sets to gain predictive insights. From my perspective, *a rising tide floats all boats*. Will palantir continue to lead the race? Of course. But even if big bear is 2nd or 3rd place, at its current price level it could still be a huge play. 

3. 2024 Q3 22.1% revenue increase to $41.5m and an improved gross margin of 25.9%, despite a net loss of $12.2m. 

4. Obviously this is a small cap stock with cheap shares. With a currently 710 million dollar market cap (relative to palantir’s 162 billion dollar market cap, there’s obviously a lot more room for growth if BB can continue to secure new contracts). 

5. The company is also delivering face biometrics in support of an aviation security partnership between Delta Airlines and the TSA. Acquired Pangiam in 2023, a leader in facial recognition tech (CEO was former Director of Homeland Security).

6. Very diverse revenue streams. They are building data driven AI solutions across multiple industries. Airlines, warehousing, healthcare, military, you name it. 


7. Institutional ownership slowly beginning to rise. All it would take is one serious institution to get involved and this thing will sky rocket to $5-6.


In conclusion, Palantir has become expensive as fuckall, while shares of the bear offer potentially more upside in the more than likely scenario where its results begin to outperform expectations.

Due Diligence (DD): Vulcan Energy Resources (VUL) 🚀🔥

Ticker: $VUL.AX (ASX)

Industry: Green Energy / Lithium Mining

Market Cap: ~ €700 Million

Price at DD Creation: 3,85€


---

TL;DR:

Vulcan Energy is a small-cap green lithium play that's combining ESG-friendly vibes with big brain German engineering to meet the EV revolution's insatiable appetite for lithium. They're doing this without destroying the planet, meaning diamond hands = green hands 🌱💎. Think Tesla, but they're digging up the battery gold while saving the environment. Future EV supply chain kingpin? Maybe. Future gains? Likely.


---

What Makes Vulcan Energy Unique?

1. Geothermal + Lithium Extraction 🔋🔥:

Vulcan has a patented, zero-carbon lithium extraction process using geothermal energy in Germany’s Upper Rhine Valley.

They literally produce lithium and clean energy simultaneously. Two revenue streams. Two words: BIG BRAIN. 🧠



2. Europe's Backyard Goldmine 🏔️:

Located in Europe’s EV production hub = low transportation costs.

EU’s push for domestic lithium supply = regulatory tailwind.



3. Signed Contracts with the Big Boys 🚗:

Agreements with Renault, Stellantis (makers of Jeep/Peugeot), and VW Group. These aren’t scrubs.



4. The Lithium Squeeze is Real 📈:

EV adoption is skyrocketing, and lithium demand is outpacing supply.

Vulcan’s tech is sustainable AND cost-effective, so they can scale without environmental protests slowing them down.





---

The Numbers (Because We Know WSB Loves Tendies):

Resource Estimate: ~15.85Mt LCE (Lithium Carbonate Equivalent), one of the largest in the world.

Production Potential: Could meet 25-30% of Europe's lithium demand.

Cash: Strong balance sheet post-raising AUD $200M+ in 2023 to fund expansion.

Risks & Why Bears Could Cry About It 🐻😭

1. Tech Validation: The direct lithium extraction process is new and not yet proven at scale. Bears call it ""vaporware,"" but early tests look good.


2. CapEx Costs: Scaling new tech isn't cheap, but their recent funding helps.


3. Price Volatility: Lithium prices are cyclical. $VUL isn't immune to dips.


4. Execution Risks: Any delay in project timelines could spook weak hands.

Why Vulcan Could Send Us to Valhalla 🛡️⚡

1. EV Battery Boom: By 2030, global EV sales are projected to hit 40M annually. Vulcan is perfectly positioned to supply Europe’s battery makers.


2. Environmentally Friendly Narrative: Funds and investors are increasingly ESG-focused. Vulcan is a textbook ESG darling.


3. Scarcity + Patents: Nobody else is doing zero-carbon lithium extraction on this scale. First-mover advantage = 🚀.




---

Catalysts to Watch 🚀

1. 2024-2025: Commercial production rollout. If they hit their milestones, this stock could fly.


2. New contracts with more automakers or battery companies.


3. Potential listing on a bigger exchange (e.g., NASDAQ).

The Play

This is a long-term buy-and-hold for those who believe in the lithium revolution and want a slice of an ESG-friendly supply chain. Not financial advice, but maybe DCA your way into this future powerhouse. The next Tesla/Microsoft/Amazon starts as a small player. Why not Vulcan?

Position: 💎💎💎 or GTFO.

MEME SECTION:

🚀 $VUL on the Moon Plan:

Diamond Hands = Saving the Planet 🌍 + Bags of Tendies 🤑

Warren Buffett: “If you can’t hold $VUL for 10 years, don’t hold it for 10 minutes.”

Elon Musk 2026: “Wow, Vulcan Energy is literally saving our supply chain. Can I buy you?”



---

Closing Thoughts:
This isn’t just any lithium stock. This is lithium with vibes, and we all know that’s what the market loves these days. Is there risk? Sure. Is there potential for insane gains? You bet your 🚀 portfolio there is. See you in Valhalla, WSB.

Disclaimer: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a degenerate's green energy moonshot thesis. Do your own DD, or YOLO and regret nothing.

","Chat gpt DD is worth a read Honestly a couple of important facts and achievements are missing, but actually it's more about the fact that ChatGpt made this regarded DD... I swear I did not add or change one thing. It already knows that our brains are toast. 

I said that it should create a DD WSB would like:


Due Diligence (DD): Vulcan Energy Resources (VUL) 🚀🔥

Ticker: $VUL.AX (ASX)

Industry: Green Energy / Lithium Mining

Market Cap: ~ €700 Million

Price at DD Creation: 3,85€


---

TL;DR:

Vulcan Energy is a small-cap green lithium play that's combining ESG-friendly vibes with big brain German engineering to meet the EV revolution's insatiable appetite for lithium. They're doing this without destroying the planet, meaning diamond hands = green hands 🌱💎. Think Tesla, but they're digging up the battery gold while saving the environment. Future EV supply chain kingpin? Maybe. Future gains? Likely.

What Makes Vulcan Energy Unique?

1. Geothermal + Lithium Extraction 🔋🔥:

Vulcan has a patented, zero-carbon lithium extraction process using geothermal energy in Germany’s Upper Rhine Valley.

They literally produce lithium and clean energy simultaneously. Two revenue streams. Two words: BIG BRAIN. 🧠



2. Europe's Backyard Goldmine 🏔️:

Located in Europe’s EV production hub = low transportation costs.

EU’s push for domestic lithium supply = regulatory tailwind.



3. Signed Contracts with the Big Boys 🚗:

Agreements with Renault, Stellantis (makers of Jeep/Peugeot), and VW Group. These aren’t scrubs.



4. The Lithium Squeeze is Real 📈:

EV adoption is skyrocketing, and lithium demand is outpacing supply.
